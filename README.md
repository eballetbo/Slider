## License

The firmware is published under the [GPLv3 license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eballetbo/Slider/master/LICENSE) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use the Slider firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep the software open, and you must provide your compatible Slider source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Slider license is to make a fork of Slider on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.
